## About the Project 

This project is based on the FrailSafe project, which aims to better understand frailty and its relation to other health conditions.

There are two datasets with measurements from older adults collected within the FrailSafe project. 
- The first dataset contains information which is recorded daily with the use of smart beacon devices and concern the older people’s movement in their home setting. 
- The second dataset contains information which was collected during the clinical evaluation of the older people from medical experts. This information represents the clinical status of the older person across different domains (physical, psychological, cognitive, etc).

*This project prepared for my [M.Sc.](https://ddcdm.ceid.upatras.gr/en/641-2/) course "Big Data Analysis".*

## Build with 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Python 

## Tasks 
The project consists of three parts: 

###### *PART A*
- Preprocessing of the [clinical dataset](clinical_dataset.csv) 
- Classification based on the "fried" parameter

###### *PART B*
- Preprocessing of the [beacons dataset](beacons_dataset.csv)
- Merging the two preprocessed datasets
- Clustering on the final preprocessed dataset 
- Evaluation of the clustering using internal criteria
